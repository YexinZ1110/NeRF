## NeRF
In this project, we implemented the application of Neural Radiance Fields in rendering both 2D and 3D scenes. Initially, we adapt a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for the task of fitting a 2D image by employing positional encoding techniques. Subsequently, we shift our focus to 3D environments and employ Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a cutting-edge methodology, for the representation and rendering of 3D scenes from various 2D perspectives. We develop a neural network integrated with positional encoding and utilize volumetric rendering to generate new viewpoints of the scene.
